Thread Safety:

1) synchronized(lock) ensures only one thread calculates and prints factorial at a time.
2) Prevents race conditions and interleaving of output in shared console/logs.

Exception Handling:

1) Custom Exception: InvalidThreadOperationException handles invalid input for factorial.

2) Built-in Exceptions:

    2a) InterruptedException in NumberPrinter.

    2b) IllegalThreadStateException while starting threads.
